# Late Night Coffee
A portfolio of miscellaneous projects worked on by Raymond Chang and Charles Tian. These projects and repositories are for our personal learning and future reference.

Why is our organization URL https://github.com/Early-Morning-Tea and our name Late Night Coffee? Well, we wanted to have the URL match up with the name, but it was already taken. So we just flipped the name.
